# fagan
A variant of the Self Attention GAN named: FAGAN (Full Attention GAN).
The architecture of this gan contains the full attention layer 
as proposed in this project.

The project uses package named `attn-gan-pytorch` created by me, 
which is available at https://pypi.org/project/attn-gan-pytorch/ .

## Celeba samples

samples generated during training of the proposed architecture 
on the celeba dataset.

## Full attention layer

<p>
The above figure describes the architecture of the proposed 
full attention layer. As you can see, on the upper path we compute 
traditional convolution output and the lower path, we have an 
attention layer which generalises to (k x k) convolution filters 
instead of just (1 x 1) filters. The alpha shown in the residual 
calculation is a trainable parameter.
</p> <br>

<p>
Now why is the lower path not self attention? The reason for 
it is that while computing the attention maps, the input is first 
locally aggregated by the (k x k) convolutions, and therefore is no 
longer just self attention since it uses a small spatially neighbouring 
area into computations. Given enough depth and filter size, 
we could cover the entire input image as a receptive field for a 
subsequent attention calculation, hence the name: Full Attention.

## Celeba Experiment

#### Hinge-Gan loss experiment
The following diagram is the plot of the loss (Hinge-GAN) generated from
the loss-logs obtained during training.

#### Relativistic Hinge-Gan loss experiment
Following are some of the samples obtained while training using the 
**relativistic** `hinge-gan` loss function proposed in the paper
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00734"> here</a>.

<br>
The training of the relativistic version is percetually better (stabler) 
as seen from the samples gif. Refer to the following loss_plot
for this experiment for more info.<br>

## Running the Code
Running the training is actually very simple. 
Just install the `attn_gan_pytorch` package using the following command

    $ workon [your virtual environment]
    $ pip install attn-gan-pytorch

And then run the training by running the `train.py` script. Refer to 
the following parameters for tweaking for your own use:

## Trained weights for generating cool faces :)
refer to the `models/fagan_1/` directory to find the saved weights for 
this model in pytorch format. For spawning the architectures,
refer to the `configs/` folder for loading the `generator`
and `discriminator` configurations.
